# Metal is forged
Every compute second must be justified, especially given the inference costs of large model use. 

# Forge times metal
Equals efficient and powerful use of data. 

# COREML Model Evolution Tracking
This model tracking library, built in Swift and C++, implements a few simple methods for optimization and testing of on-device ML algos. While we have the local compute, why not use it first and save the Amazon?

# Forge is compatible with other ML ops theory
Integrate your logging and understanding into ML iteration.
